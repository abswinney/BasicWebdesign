            <h2>Games are for Everyone</h2>

            <p>Video games are considered one of the easiest accessible forms of entertainment. People no longer need to go to a store to be entertained. Delivering both story and interaction draws the player in. However, there are some games that are not as accessible as others. The lack of accessibility is creating a divide between gamers of all kinds. While some are just playing for the story, these same people are getting bullied for not playing the game on the highest level of difficulty. Those who are playing at the highest level often burn out due to the challenges taking too long to complete. </p>

            <p>Finding a good balance between the two is no easy feat. Having technical skill does not mean a player will complete the fight. Some games require the player to input a multitude of hours into the game to able to have enough stats to make a dent in a boss. Or the player might need certain items to defeat an enemy and the item drop is completely random. Both instances are common occurrences in MMORPGs.</p>
