        <p>More and more developers are using old tricks to “increase” the difficulty of games, but all it really does is lengthen the time players spend on one enemy or instance. This includes increasing the enemy's health pool to outstanding levels, increasing the number of minion summons, adding unnecessary resistances. The player may experience fatigue during this battle, allowing for mistakes to happen giving the illusion of a hard fight.</p>
        <p>Developers may also limit the character's health being that if the player slips up more than once it could be game over. Filling the room with poisonous gas that chips away at the player's health while hitting a boss with a large health pool. Or if they are feeling real spicy, break the player's items and make them useless. Yep, all that effort for nothing.  </p>

        <p>Below is a small example of how this directly applies to a game. The slime gains no additional abilities or movement. Only it's health, damage, and defense change when players unlock hardmode. In this case hardmode is considered Phase 2 of Terraria. The slime can be almost anywhere in the game at any given time.</p>
