            <h1>Earth Kingdom</h1>
            <p>The Earth Kingdom is one of the world's four nations. Spanning most of a continent as well as several subsidiary islands, it is the largest and most populated sovereignty in the world and encompasses much of the eastern hemisphere. The kingdom operates as a monarchy under the rule of a single Earth Monarch, although the power of its rulers has historically greatly fluctuated.</p>
            <p>The Earth Kingdom was founded after the city state of Ba Sing Se, its later capital, forcibly subjugated several other polities. As a result, the nation is traditionally characterized by significant diversity and divided into quasi-autonomous regions with their own ethnicities, cultures, governments, and laws. It is home to most earthbenders. The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong; they usually adhered to a philosophy of peaceful coexistence and cooperation with the other nations of the world. Originally one of the most powerful empires in the world, the Earth Kingdom experienced a series of crises, civil wars, and political unrest in the 4th and 3rd century BG. This decline was eventually halted, and the Earth Kingdom began to flourish with a long period of internal peace and economic development during the long life of Avatar Kyoshi. However, the constitution that she helped draft was eventually undermined by Earth King Jialun, resulting in an increasingly corrupt and uncaring government as well as the growth of internal tensions. Even though, much of the Earth Kingdom continued to prosper, boasting a large economy, the country began to fall behind in regard to industrialization and technological progress.</p>

                    <td>Toph Beifong: A blind Earthbending grandmaster of the prestigious Beifong family in the Earth Kingdom. Toph is often sarcastic, direct, and confrontational; commonly depicted as the choleric and tomboy of the group. Though blind, Toph can feel vibrations in the earth. Through this heightened sense, she can identify people's locations, their distance from her, and their physical build. She learned this technique from the blind Badger Moles. This 'seismic sense' provides her with a distinct advantage when facing other Earthbenders in combat, as they require contact with the ground and extract rocks from their surroundings. As another result of her blindness, Toph has acute hearing, enabling her to recognize people by the sound of their voices and to eavesdrop on distant conversations.</td>

She is an exceptionally skilled fighter, first meeting Team Avatar when they visited her home of Kyoshi Island, where she captured the intruders. She also humiliated Sokka, causing him to change his chauvinistic ways, eventually striking up a friendship as she taught him how to fight.</td>
