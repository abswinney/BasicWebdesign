    <h2>Visit local!</h2>
    <p>Living on a budget does not mean you have to miss out. Working as a full-time student and having a full time job meant I needed to get creative for my time off. With only 3 days to use for paid-time off, I decided to stay fairly local and rented a cabin in Raising Fawn. It wasn't the most private but far enough to where no one bothered us and light polution was low for stargazing. It was quiet and the air was crisp in the nights of early October. Getting away from the city and being out in nature is something I had not done since I was a child. </p>
    <p>Though the cabin was comfy, the walk around Cloudland Canyon was the best experience. There are 2 easy to get to waterfalls as long as you don't mind stairs. The trails for both are about 2 miles in total and narrow in some places. Sadly, the waterfalls were a bit on the skinny side because it had been dryer weather but the journey was rewarding none-the-less. There are many trails to walk with all amazing views. Go visit Cloudland Canyon for yourself. </p>
